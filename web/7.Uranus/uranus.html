                 <h1>URANUS</h1>
                 
                 <h2>General Facts</h2>
                 The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy.<br> 
                 The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.<br> 
                 This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.<br><br>

                 <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                 Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. <br>
                 The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br>

                 <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                 With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth.<br> 
                 If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.<br>
                 From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
                 One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.<br> 
                 From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.<br><br>

                 <h2>Structure</h2>
                 Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune).<br> 
                 Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core.<br> 
                 Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).<br>
                 Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops.<br> 
                 Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color.<br><br>

                 <h2>Surface</h2>
                 As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids.<br> 
                 While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either.<br> 
                 The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.<br><br>

                 <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                 Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia.<br> 
                 The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color. While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot,<br> 
                 and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as <br>
                 it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features.
