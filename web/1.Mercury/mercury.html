                 <h1>MERCURY</h1>
			<h2> General Facts </h2>
                 
                 The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.<br>
		 From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when view from Earth,<br>
		 and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.<br>
		 Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun,<br>
		 day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night,<br> 
		 temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).
		 Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs<br> 
		 to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
		 Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.<br><br>

		 <h2> Potential for Life </h2>
		
		 Mercury’s environment is not conducive to life as we know it.<br>
	         The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.<br> 
		 Mercury doesn’t have moons and Mercury doesn’t have rings.<br><br>

		 <h2> Size and Distance </h2>
		 With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.<br> 
		 If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.
		 From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
		 One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,<br> 
		 it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.<br><br>

		 <h2> Structure </h2>
		 Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers),<br> 
		 about 85 percent of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or liquid. Mercury's outer shell,<br> 
		 comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.<br><br>

		 <h2> Surface </h2>
		 Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets.<br> 
		 Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors,<br> 
		 including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.<br>
		 Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter),<br> 
		 were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain,<br> 
		 there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted<br> 
		 over the billions of years since Mercury formed. Temperatures on Mercury are extreme.<br>
		 During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).<br> 
		 Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit<br> 
		 (minus 180 degrees Celsius). Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters,<br> 
		 but only in regions in permanent shadows. In those shadows,<br> 
		 it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet.<br><br>

		 <h2> Atmosphere </h2>
		 Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids.<br>
		 Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.
