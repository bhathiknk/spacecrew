                 <h1>SATURN</h1>
                 
                 <h2>General Facts</h2>
                 Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.<br> 
                 Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br> 
                 Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's.<br> 
                 Saturn also has dozens of moons.<br><br>

                 <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                 Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it.<br> 
                 The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br>
                 While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.<br> 
                 Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.<br><br>

                 <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                 With a radius of 36,183.7 miles (58,232 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth.<br> 
                 If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.<br>
                 From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
                 One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.<br><br>

                 <h2>Structure</h2>
                 Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br> 
                 At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat.<br> 
                 It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen –similar to Jupiter's core but considerably smaller.<br><br>

                 <h2>Surface</h2>
                 As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down.<br>
                 While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.<br> 
                 The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.<br><br>

                 <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                 Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown, and gray.<br>
                 Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region.<br>
                 In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second).<br> 
                 And the pressure – the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater – is so powerful it squeezes gas into a liquid.
