                 <h1>JUPITER</h1>

                 <h2>General Facts</h2>
                 Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.<br> 
                 Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.<br> 
                 Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.<br><br>

                 <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                 Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it.<br> 
                 The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br>
                 While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.<br> 
                 Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system.<br> 
                 There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.<br><br>

                 <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                 With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth.<br> 
                 If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.<br>
                 From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
                 One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.<br><br>

                 <h2>Structure</h2>
                 The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid.<br> 
                 This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water.<br> 
                 Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms,<br> 
                 making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field.<br> 
                 It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup.<br> 
                 It could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down there, made mostly of iron and silicate minerals (similar to quartz).<br><br>

                 <h2>Surface</h2>
                 As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids.<br> 
                 While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.<br> 
                 The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.<br><br>

                 <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                 Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and spots. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers).<br>
                 The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals.<br>
                 The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.
