                 <h1>NEPTUNE</h1>
                 
                 <h2>General Facts</h2>
                 Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.<br>
                 More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye.<br> 
                 In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.<br>
                 Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us.<br> 
                 The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.<br><br>

                 <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                 Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. <br>
                 The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br>

                 <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                 With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.<br> 
                 If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.<br>
                 From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
                 One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,<br>
                 it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.<br><br>

                 <h2>Structure</h2>
                 Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus).<br> 
                 Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core.<br>
                 Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.<br><br>

                 <h2>Surface</h2>
                 Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths,<br> 
                 gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth.<br><br>

                 <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                 Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane.<br> 
                 Neptune's neighbor Uranus is a blue-green color due to such atmospheric methane, but Neptune is a more vivid, brighter blue,<br> 
                 so there must be an unknown component that causes the more intense color.
