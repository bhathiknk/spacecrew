                 <h1>EARTH</h1>
                 
                 <h2> General Facts </h2>
		 Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far thatâ€™s inhabited by living things.<br> 
		 While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system,<br> 
		 it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus,<br> 
		 Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.<br><br>

		 <h2> Potential for Life </h2>
		 Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.<br> 
		 Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water,<br> 
		 since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time.<br> 
		 Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.<br><br>
		 
		 <h2> Size and Distance </h2>
		 With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet overall.<br>
		 From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun<br> 
		 because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.<br> 
		 This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.<br>
		 It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.<br><br>

		 <h2> Structure </h2>
		 Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust.<br>
		 The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius.<br> 
		 There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core.<br> 
		 This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.<br>
		 In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel.<br> 
		 The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean,<br> 
		 the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.<br><br>
	
		 <h2> Moons </h2>
		 Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky.<br> 
		 In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble,<br> 
		 which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.<br>
		 Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun<br><br>

		 <h2> Surface </h2>
		 Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle,<br> 
		 is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin,<br> 
		 roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another,<br> 
		 collide to make mountains, or split and separate.<br>
		 Earth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth's water.<br> 
		 Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater.<br> 
		 Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.<br><br>

		 <h2> Atmosphere </h2>
		 Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and neon.<br> 
		 The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun.<br> 
		 It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
