                 <h1>VENUS</h1>
		
			<h2> General Facts </h2>
			It's a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, often called Earth’s twin. But pull up a bit closer,<br>
	 		and Venus turns hellish. Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead.<br>
 			The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a smear of light.<br>
			In some ways it is more an opposite of Earth than a twin: Venus spins backward, has a day longer than its year,<br> 
			and lacks any semblance of seasons. It might once have been a habitable ocean world, like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago.<br> 
			A runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapor, which then leaked slowly into space.<br> 
			The present-day surface of volcanic rock is blasted by high temperatures and pressures.<br><br> 
			
			<h2> Potential for Life </h2>
			Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers), temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius), a range that, even at its higher-end,<br> 
			could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.<br>
			At the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 miles (360 kilometers) per hour, we find another transformation.<br> 
			Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds.<br> 
			They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.<br><br>
			
			<h2> Size and Distance </h2>
			Our nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth – 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across,<br> 
			versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon.<br> 
			The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star.<br> 
			That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.<br>	
			Because Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each other.<br> 
			The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning),<br> 
			then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.<br>
			At its nearest to Earth, Venus is some 38 million miles (about 61 million kilometers) distant.<br> 
			But most of the time the two planets are farther apart; Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than Venus.<br><br>

			<h2> Structure </h2>
			If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar.<br> 
			Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust.<br> 
			On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.<br><br>

			<h2> Surface </h2>
			The broiling surface of Venus has been a topic of heated discussion among planetary scientists.<br> 
			The traditional picture includes a catastrophic, planetwide resurfacing between 350 and 750 million years ago.<br> 
			In other words, Venus appears to have completely erased most traces of its early surface.<br> 
			The causes: volcanic and tectonic forces, which could include surface buckling and massive eruptions.<br> 
			But newer estimates made with help from computer models paint a different portrait.<br> 
			While the same forces would be at work, resurfacing would be piecemeal over an extended time.<br> 
			The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.<br><br>

			<h2> Atmosphere </h2>
			The Soviet Union landed 10 probes on the surface of Venus, but even among the few that functioned after landing,<br> 
			the successes were short-lived – the longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes.<br> 
			Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.
