                 <h1>MARS</h1>
                 
                 <h2>General Facts</h2>
                 Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It’s dry, rocky, and bitter cold.<br> 
                 The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other).<br> 
                 Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.<br><br>

                 <h2>Potential for Life</h2>
                 Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars.<br> 
                 Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.<br><br>

                 <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
                With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel,<br>
                Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers),<br> 
                Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.<br> 
                From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.<br><br>

                <h2>Structure</h2>
                Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius.<br> 
                It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that,<br> 
                a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.<br><br>

                <h2>Surface</h2>
                The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan.<br> 
                The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars.<br> 
                This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.<br><br>

                <h2>Atmosphere</h2>
                Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.<br> 
                To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth.<br> 
                Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.
